# Keiana's guide to (not fucking up) the product management interview

*After one too many people sliding into my Linkedin DMs to get insight (aka referrals) into the PM role, I finally took the time to compile all of the resources I used during my interview process (aka three years of bookmarked links). This absolute shitstorm (sprinkled with some personal anecdotes and advice) of a document is the result. I'm very glad I don't have to do this again anytime soon; I hope it gets you through it too.*



#### Before we start, some very real advice

- I really hope you get a nice-ass paying job out of all of this! If you don't, it's okay. I did this interview process **three** *goddamn* years in a row, and didn't get a single FAANG/top tech internship out of it. Failure is never easy, and it hit me really hard that I wasn't "good enough" for Google or Microsoft. like *really hard*. I questioned my self-worth constantly (which, is ridiculous in hindsight, because the proportion of population even with the chance to interview at Microsoft is **microscopic** (lol), and these companies are so notoriously selective they've made movies about it)

  In the meantime, I did UNPAID work at a very old company, participated in Karlie Kloss's coding bootcamp, interned at another unknown startup, and volunteered by teaching computer science in Palestine. Now that I'm actually working at Microsoft, I'm so fucking grateful that I had those experiences, because how boring of a person would I be without them? 

  *There's a larger conversation to have about the "inherent" worth we assign to these companies, and questioning if our work is actually proportional to the satisfaction we receive working there....but I'll leave that to you to dwell on.*

- **PLEASE** make sure to take care of yourself. There's a toxic culture of overworking that surrounds this process, and it often turns into a competition of whose slept the least or applied to the most companies (see next point). At the end of the day, it's just a job. Get some sleep. Eat balanced and regular meals. Go get some exercise. Hang out with your friends once in a while. Make sure you have someone you can talk to if you're so stressed out. Make sure not *all* of your conversations are about tech. (God I sound like a mom, or even worse, Jordan Peterson.)

- *Please* don't spend too much time lurking /r/cscareerquestions or teamblind; the people who post on these sites are a very absurd extrapolation of the population of candidates, and it will not take very long for you to feel defeated or exhausted by the seemingly endless stream of comparing hours of Leetcode or negotiating $120k vs. $130k MSFT vs Google. use these resources as necessary, but reminder that these people are NOT you and do not have the same experience as you do. <u>chill out.</u>

- It should be obvious, but this is my personal experience with the interview process. I've disassociated enough to be able to write this guide in hindsight, but my experience in interviewing will definitely not be the same as yours. You might not even have the same goals as I did when I was sociopathically grinding to appear palatable to Big Tech! That's okay! The important thing is you can learn something from this. Saying that, please don't find me on social media and spam me with hate mail that you didn't. thanks!



### Introduction

So you want to get hired as a PM! Cool, welcome to the club. Seriously, it feels like everyone and their sister is trying for these interviews. Start with actually understanding what product management is, what a PM does, how it's different from typical entry-level roles at tech companies, etc. Then we'll get our hands dirty with the real interview prep ;)



**The "before" resources**

*I call these the "before" resources because they're for before you really start doing anything. These are famous readings about product management, anecdotes from current PMs, and other things you should read before you start any application or DMing anyone on Linkedin.*

First, [ProductHired's Open Product Management repo](https://github.com/ProductHired/open-product-management) is a "curated list of product management advice for technical people" with an insane list of resources.

Second, [The Tech Interview Handbook](https://yangshun.github.io/tech-interview-handbook/introduction) does a great job explaining the logistics from start to end of the actual interview (along with providing helpful resources on algorithms, etc.) **I'm not going to explain the actual interview process, and this link does it much better than I could ever. Please refer to as necessary.**

*If, at this point, you're convinced this is the position you want to go for, let's get started!* I would start with getting the essential reading done. These are **[Cracking the Coding Interview](https://github.com/alxerg/Books-1/blob/master/Cracking%20the%20Coding%20Interview%2C%206th%20Edition%20189%20Programming%20Questions%20and%20Solutions.pdf)** and [**Cracking the PM Interview**](https://github.com/drew-mn/Books/blob/master/Cracking%20the%20PM%20Interview.pdf), both by iconic tech queen Gayle Laakmann McDowell. These are the bread and butter of tech interviews, especially for candidates still in school. I got physical copies of both because I revisited chapters so often and beat them up with all of the notes and post-its I added, but YMMV (your mileage may vary).



##### The application process

There are a bajillion lists of all the PM programs floating around the internet, but I found several:

- (https://apmlist.com/
- (https://www.productalliance.com/internship-list)

- (https://collegeproductmanager.com/pm-jobs/)

- [random list from Reddit](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ZmDio9v-x8nWUDNGCNfpiCOtWjqn41fAFiKWX0SqNfI/edit#gid=39989556)

The aggressive candidate will apply to as many companies on those lists as she can, which is totally fine. But honestly, I found myself applying to companies I never actually wanted to work at. Personally, I wanted to pick a dozen or so from the list, and dedicate my time to making myself a kickass application to get that interview. 

*I suggest making your own excel spreadsheet to track your interviews--where you are in the process for each company, if you have any referrals, any deadlines you need to make, etc. Current candidates ask me all the time for when they should expect to hear back from company X; I can give them my personal experience based on the dates from my spreadsheet.*

- to add: screenshot of spreadsheet

**(In my experience) the most important factor in getting your foot in the door is a referral**. This often leaves people resorting to DMing every employee on Linkedin and blind-messaging former high school classmates at Google on Facebook (guilty); really, this should be a much more thought-out process that starts MONTHS/YEARS before your application. It means getting involved in your local ACM/IEEE/flavor of tech organization of your choice; attending company events and getting to know your recruiter; networking the shit out of yourself. *I know it's fucking exhausting and terrible and you would rather spend your time actually having fun*, but it makes the referral process a lot less painful when you know people have your back. I made a ton of friends during my time working with UCLA ACM, *and* it so happens that many of those people are now at top tech companies that are generous with their referrals if I want them. I'm not telling you to farm friends for referrals, but do what you gotta do (in a non-sociopathic way).

* Of course, a referral is not a guarantee. Sometimes it is just putting your name in a smaller (still gigantic) database of applications, not to be confused with the absolutely endless database of non-referred applications. But having someone vouch for you can be a good indicator.





### Actual interview preparation

#### Topic-specific links

**Behavioral/personality related**

*Tell me about yourself* are the four words I'm tired of hearing from both first dates and interviewers, but you gotta do what you gotta do. The behavioral part is the chance at a great first impression; my advice is **don't be a robot** and actually have a conversation with the person on the other side of the table/phone screen. They're also a human being (hopefully they act like one in the interview!)

*Be able to explain your resume to your interviewer*. Tell them what you're involved in, what you're passionate about, how that passion has translated into action you've taken in projects/hackathons/volunteering/etc. (that means not adding bullshit bullet points and fluff to make it look like a complete one page). I've heard that certain companies like certain aspects of a candidate's resume: for example, Microsoft looks for teaching/volunteering experience; Facebook looks for hackathon or individual project experience; Google looks for experience with startups or projects developing actually serious products. Use this to tailor your resume as needed (or as motivation to get involved in something).

**Product questions**

I split these questions into two categories: "soft"--explaining your understanding of product management/design/etc., providing examples-- and "hard"--designing products from prompts, critiquing your process. Interviewers often start with a "soft" question for a few minutes, then dedicate the majority of the interview to solving one (or several) "hard" questions. Make sure to be well versed in both.

- *soft*

**Coding problems**

*Personal note:* honestly, I didn't focus too much on grinding in Leetcode for my interviews, and I never really got serious whiteboard questions during any of my PM-specific interviews. Be my guest to spend your time doing this, but I would make sure you have a solid grasp on the fundamentals, then focus more of your time on product-style q's.

**System design questions** 

*Personal note:* I find this to be the topic I overlooked the most for my interview prep. Most of the books I read didn't include too much on sys design, but I was asked questions in both my Google and Microsoft interviews that definitely required preparation from this subject. There are a LOT of links below because I wanted as much info as possible; use at your discretion.

### Before the actual interview(s)

- *Research the position you're interviewing for*. Sounds obvious, but if you can get insight to exactly what team you're interviewing for and who is interviewing you, it'll be much easier heading into the interview to know how to respond and which questions to ask at the end. My final interviews for Microsoft were for COSINE, which at the time included Windows (Core OS) and Intelligent Edge devices (IoT); I prepared to have at least a couple questions about operating systems or device limitations.

- more advice here would probably be helpful
